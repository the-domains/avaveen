# Maya Hayuk

With their symmetrical compositions, intricate patterns, and lush colors, Maya Hayuk's paintings and massively scaled murals recall views of outer space, traditional Ukrainian crafts, airbrushed manicures, and mandalas. Hayuk weaves visual information from her immediate surroundings into her elaborate abstractions, creating an engaging mix of referents from popular culture and advanced painting practices alike while connecting to the ongoing pursuit of psychedelic experience in visual form. She has painted her iconic outdoor murals all over the world and, when not traveling, maintains an active studio in Brooklyn, sketching in paint to inform the large-scale works. She sees her studio painting practice and mural making as both inversely relational and symbiotic.

Maya Hayuk earned a BFA in Interrelated Media from Massachusetts College of Art and has studied at V.C.U., Richmond, VA, Ontario College of Art and Design, Toronto, Canada, the University of Odessa, Odessa, Ukraine and at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Skowhegan, Maine.
